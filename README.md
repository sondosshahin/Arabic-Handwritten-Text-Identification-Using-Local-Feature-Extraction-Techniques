# Arabic-Handwritten-Text-Identification-Using-Local-Feature-Extraction-Techniques
## ENCS5343 Computer Vision  - Assignment 2
### The aim of this assignment was to explore and apply local feature extraction techniques to identify handwritten texts. Feature extraction algorithms such as SIFT and ORB were evaluated based on accuracy, efficiency, and robustness to variations in the handwritten samples.
### The objective of this assignment was to classify the images so that when the model takes an image as an input, it can determine which user wrote the word in the image.
